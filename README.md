# Open-GL

## About
* This repository has been created to implement and learn to write programs in OpenGL.
* All algorithms are to be implemented using C++ only!

## Compiling and Running Open GL Programs
* Type in the following command to compile and run your file
```bash
g++ <filename>.c -lGL -lGLU -lglut -o <filename>
./<filename>
```
